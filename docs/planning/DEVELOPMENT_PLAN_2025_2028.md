2. **Quick research** (30 min to understand concepts)
3. **Build basic version** (2-3 hours)
4. **Refine with best practices** (1-2 hours)
5. **Ask me for code review** (async, throughout day)

### My Role as Instructor:
- **Available 24/7** for questions (async responses)
- **Code reviews** when you push commits
- **Architecture guidance** before major decisions
- **Resource recommendations** for specific topics
- **Debugging help** when stuck
- **Accountability** through progress check-ins

### Learning Integration:
- **Morning hour**: New concepts when fresh
- **Evening hours**: Implementation and practice
- **Weekends**: Deeper architectural work
- **Throughout day**: Quick questions via our chat

4. Consider consulting as bridge income

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Success Factors

### Technical Priorities:
1. Ship working code > perfect code
2. Get user feedback > add features
3. Revenue > vanity metrics
4. Simple > complex always

### Business Priorities:
1. NCAA proof â†’ NWSL trust

3. Retention > acquisition
4. Word of mouth > paid ads

### Personal Priorities:
1. Consistency > intensity
2. Health > hustle
3. Learning > knowing
4. Progress > perfection

## ðŸ“± Communication & Support

### Daily Check-ins:
- Push code by 9pm
- I'll review overnight
- Morning responses ready

### Weekly Reviews:
- Sunday 6pm: Week recap

- Celebrate wins

### Emergency Support:
- Stuck >30 minutes? Ask me
- Major decisions? Ask first
- Burned out? Let's adjust

## ðŸš¦ Go/No-Go Checkpoints

### Q1 2026 (6 months):
- **Go**: 1+ paying customer
- **Pivot**: No customer interest
- **Decision**: Double down or adjust

### Q3 2026 (12 months):
- **Go**: $5K+/month revenue
- **No-go**: <$2K/month
- **Decision**: Job transition timing

### Q1 2027 (18 months):
- **Go**: NWSL contracts signed
- **No-go**: No NWSL interest
- **Decision**: Scale or exit

## ðŸŽ¯ The Bottom Line

**You will succeed if you**:
1. Code 3 hours every weekday
2. Code 8 hours every weekend
3. Ship something every week
4. Get customer feedback monthly
5. Ask for help when stuck

**The math**: 
- 25 hrs/week Ã— 52 weeks = 1,300 hours/year
- 1,300 hours = Senior engineer expertise
- 2 years = 2,600 hours = Two successful products

**Most likely outcome**: By 2027 World Cup, you'll be running a profitable sports tech company with NWSL clients, building toward an 8-figure exit while Vector grows in the background.
