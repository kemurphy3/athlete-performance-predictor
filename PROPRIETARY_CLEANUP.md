# Proprietary Code Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the proprietary code that was removed from the public repository.

## Removed Components

### 1. Calorie Calculation Logic
- **EnhancedCalorieCalculator**: Advanced calorie estimation algorithms
- **MultiAthleteCalorieCalculator**: Multi-athlete support with personalized calculations
- Removed from:
  - `src/connectors/strava.py` - Replaced with simple placeholder calculation
  - `src/connectors/garmin.py` - Replaced with simple placeholder calculation
  - `src/visualization/ai_dashboard.py` - Import removed
  - `src/cli.py` - Import and calculate_calories command stubbed

### 2. VeSync Integration
- **VeSyncConnector**: Complete connector for VeSync smart devices
- Removed files:
  - `src/connectors/vesync.py` - Entire file deleted
- Updated files:
  - `src/connectors/__init__.py` - Removed VeSync imports and registry
  - `src/cli.py` - Removed VeSync authentication and configuration logic

### 3. Data Source Adapter
- No files found containing data_source_adapter references in src/

## Code Modifications

### Strava Connector
- Calorie calculation now uses Strava-provided values when available
- Falls back to simple estimate (8 cal/min) for demo purposes
- Comment added: "Calorie calculation functionality moved to private repository"

### Garmin Connector  
- Import of EnhancedCalorieCalculator removed
- Initialization of calorie calculator removed
- Calorie calculation uses Garmin values or simple estimate (8 cal/min)
- Comment added: "Calorie calculation moved to private repository"

### AI Dashboard
- Import of MultiAthleteCalorieCalculator commented out
- Calculator initialization commented out
- Comments indicate functionality moved to private repository

### CLI
- Import of MultiAthleteCalorieCalculator commented out
- `add_athlete` command now generates simple UUID instead of using calculator
- `calculate_calories` command replaced with stub message
- VeSync configuration removed from authentication flow

## Remaining Public Functionality

The public repository still contains:
- Base connector framework and interfaces
- Strava connector (with basic calorie estimation)
- Garmin connector structure (ready for implementation)
- Data models and database schema
- Visualization dashboard (without proprietary calculations)
- CLI framework for data synchronization and analysis

## Notes

All removed proprietary code should be maintained in a separate private repository. The public repository serves as a demonstration of the platform architecture and capabilities while protecting business-critical algorithms and integrations.
