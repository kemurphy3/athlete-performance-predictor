# Senior Data Scientist Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the transformation of the athlete-performance-predictor from a mid-level project to a senior/staff-level data science platform, incorporating perspectives from Lead Data Scientists, CEOs, Professional Athletes, and Entrepreneurs.

## 🎯 Cross-Perspective Implementation Plan

### 1. Injury Prevention System

**Stakeholder Perspectives:**
- **Lead DS:** Build LSTM model with 21-day injury risk forecasting using biomechanical asymmetry detection
- **CEO:** Too complex - start with simple risk scores that insurance partners can understand
- **Athlete:** Need immediate actionable feedback, not just risk percentages
- **Entrepreneur:** Patent the algorithm first, then simplify for market

**Resolution:** Two-track approach - simple risk dashboard for immediate use, advanced ML in background for IP development

### 2. Real-time Performance Analytics

**Stakeholder Perspectives:**
- **Athlete:** Need in-game fatigue monitoring and substitution recommendations
- **Lead DS:** Requires edge computing on wearables with 5G connectivity
- **CEO:** Cost prohibitive - focus on post-game analysis first
- **Entrepreneur:** Partner with existing wearable companies rather than build hardware

**Resolution:** Build API-first platform that integrates with existing wearables, add real-time features incrementally

### 3. Soccer-Specific Features

**Stakeholder Perspectives:**
- **Athlete:** Track sprint counts, acceleration/deceleration patterns, positional heat maps
- **Lead DS:** Computer vision for tactical analysis from game footage
- **CEO:** Soccer market too niche - build sport-agnostic platform
- **Entrepreneur:** Start with soccer, expand to other sports after proving model

**Resolution:** Modular architecture with soccer as flagship vertical, expandable to other sports

### 4. Data Monetization

**Stakeholder Perspectives:**
- **CEO:** Sell anonymized data to research institutions and equipment manufacturers
- **Athlete:** Privacy concerns - my data shouldn't be sold
- **Lead DS:** Need differential privacy and federated learning to protect athletes
- **Entrepreneur:** Data co-op model where athletes get revenue share

**Resolution:** Opt-in data marketplace with athlete revenue sharing and privacy-preserving ML
