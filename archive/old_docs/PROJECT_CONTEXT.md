### Technology Stack
```python
TECH_STACK = {
    'ml': ['scikit-learn', 'pytorch', 'xgboost'],
    'api': ['fastapi', 'pydantic', 'redis'],
    'data': ['pandas', 'numpy', 'dask'],

    'infra': ['docker', 'kubernetes', 'github-actions'],
    'monitoring': ['mlflow', 'prometheus', 'grafana']
}
```

## 📈 Key Metrics & Findings

### Your Athletic Profile
- **Training**: 3-4 sessions/week, good cross-training
- **Soccer**: 2-3 games/week during tournaments
- **Risk Areas**: Tournament load spikes, no dedicated sprint work
- **Strengths**: Consistency, variety, active recovery

### Research Insights
1. **ACWR Debunked**: Recent studies show poor predictive value
2. **Asymmetry Key**: SLCMJ asymmetry = primary injury predictor
3. **HRV Valuable**: But requires individual baselines
4. **ML Superior**: Ensemble models outperform traditional metrics

### Market Opportunity
- **Problem Size**: 30-50% annual injury rate in athletes
- **Current Solutions**: Either outdated (ACWR) or expensive ($10K+)
- **Our Niche**: $29-99/month for individuals, research-backed ML

## 🎯 Unique Value Propositions

### Technical Differentiation
1. **Research Implementation**: Direct paper-to-code translations
2. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Combining biomechanical + physiological + temporal
3. **Real-Time Inference**: <50ms predictions with confidence intervals
4. **Explainable AI**: Full transparency in predictions

### Business Model
```
Individual Athletes: $29/month (basic), $99/month (premium)
Small Teams: $299-999/month
API Access: $0.001 per prediction
Enterprise: Custom pricing
```

### Portfolio Impact
- Demonstrates advanced ML (LSTM, ensemble methods)
- Shows business thinking (pricing, market analysis)
- Includes production considerations (API, monitoring)
- Has real-world impact (injury prevention)
