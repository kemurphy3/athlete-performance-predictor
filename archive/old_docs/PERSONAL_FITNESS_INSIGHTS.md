# Personal Fitness Analysis & Soccer Performance Plan

## Current Training Profile Analysis

### Training Volume & Patterns
- **Frequency:** 3-4 activities per week (Good consistency)
- **Cross-training:** Excellent variety - soccer, running, cycling, weight training, yoga
- **Soccer Focus:** 2-3 games/week during tournament periods
- **Recovery Activities:** Regular walks with Finn, yoga sessions

### Key Observations

#### Strengths
1. **Diverse Training:** Multi-modal approach reduces overuse injury risk
2. **Consistency:** Regular activity pattern across months
3. **Active Recovery:** Good incorporation of low-intensity activities
4. **Tournament Experience:** High-volume competition periods (multiple games/day)

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Sprint Training Gap:** Limited dedicated speed work
2. **Load Spikes:** Tournament weekends create extreme ACWR spikes
3. **Positional Work:** No soccer-specific agility/change of direction training
4. **Strength Imbalances:** Body part splits may create asymmetries

## Soccer-Specific Performance Optimization

### Immediate Improvements

#### 1. Speed Development (Tuesdays/Thursdays)
```
Warm-up: 10 min dynamic stretching
Main Set:
- 6 x 20m maximal sprints (3 min rest)
- 4 x 40m at 90% effort (2 min rest)
- 3 x 60m at 85% effort (3 min rest)
Cool-down: 10 min light jog + stretching
```

#### 2. Agility & Change of Direction (Wednesdays)
```
- Ladder drills: 3 sets of 5 patterns
- Cone drills: T-drill, 5-10-5, box drill
- Reactive agility: Mirror drills with partner
- Small-sided games: 3v3 or 4v4 for 20 min
```

#### 3. Power Development (Add to Weight Days)
```
Lower Body:
- Box jumps: 3x5
- Single-leg bounds: 3x8 each leg
- Lateral bounds: 3x6 each direction

Upper Body:
- Medicine ball throws: 3x8
- Plyo push-ups: 3x6
```

### Tournament Load Management

#### Pre-Tournament (Week Before)
- Reduce training volume by 30%
- Focus on mobility and light technical work
- Increase sleep to 8+ hours
- Hydration loading protocol

#### During Tournament
- HRV monitoring each morning
- 15-min recovery protocol between games:
  - Light movement
  - Compression/elevation
  - Hydration with electrolytes
- Limit warm-ups to 10 minutes

#### Post-Tournament Recovery
- 48-72 hour complete rest
- Light swimming or cycling only
- Massage/foam rolling
- Gradual return to training

## Health & Longevity Focus

### Injury Prevention Protocol

#### Daily (5-10 minutes)
- Dynamic warm-up before all activities
- Foam rolling problem areas
- Single-leg balance work

#### Weekly
- Dedicated mobility session (30 min)
- Eccentric strength training
- Video movement analysis

### Masters Athlete Considerations (Age 30+)

#### Recovery Modifications
- 1.5x recovery time vs. younger athletes
- More emphasis on sleep quality
- Regular body composition monitoring
- Joint-friendly training alternatives

#### Training Adjustments
- Longer warm-ups (15+ minutes)
- More recovery between high-intensity sessions
- Focus on movement quality over quantity
- Regular deload weeks (every 4th week)

## Personalized Metrics to Track

### Daily
- HRV (upon waking)
- Sleep quality score
- Subjective energy (1-10)
- Hydration (urine color)

### Weekly
- Total training load (TRIMP)
- ACWR calculation
- Body weight trends
- Sprint times (when tested)

### Monthly
- Body composition (DEXA or BodPod)
- Functional movement screen
- Power output tests
- 5K run time trial

## Nutrition Optimization for Soccer

### Pre-Game (3-4 hours before)
- Complex carbs: 2-3g/kg body weight
- Moderate protein: 20-30g
- Low fat, low fiber
- 500-750ml fluids
