### 1. Collect VeSync Data
```bash
python vesync_data_collector.py
```
This will:
- Connect to your VeSync account
- Discover connected devices
- Collect current and historical data
- Save raw data to `data/raw/` directory
- Generate summary reports in `data/processed/` directory

### 2. Analyze Fitness Metrics
```bash
python fitness_metrics_analyzer.py
```
This will:
- Load combined Strava and VeSync data
- Calculate comprehensive fitness metrics
- Generate performance insights
- Create visualization plots
- Save detailed reports

### 3. Automated Data Collection
Set up cron jobs or scheduled tasks for regular data collection:
```bash
# Collect VeSync data daily at 6 AM
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/project && python vesync_data_collector.py

# Generate fitness reports weekly
0 8 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && python fitness_metrics_analyzer.py
```

## üìà Key Metrics Explained

### TRIMP (Training Impulse)
- **Zone 1** (<120 bpm): Recovery/light training
- **Zone 2** (120-140 bpm): Aerobic base building
- **Zone 3** (140-160 bpm): Tempo training
- **Zone 4** (160-180 bpm): Threshold training
- **Zone 5** (>180 bpm): High-intensity intervals

### ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)
- **<0.8**: Detraining risk - increase volume gradually
- **0.8-1.3**: Optimal training zone
- **1.3-1.5**: Moderate injury risk - monitor closely
- **>1.5**: High injury risk - reduce intensity immediately

### Recovery Score Components
- **Training Load Impact**: How recent workouts affect recovery
- **ACWR Impact**: Workload balance considerations
- **Body Composition Impact**: Weight changes and hydration status
- **Sleep Quality**: Rest and recovery correlation
