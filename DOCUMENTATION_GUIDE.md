## ‚ö†Ô∏è Post-Pivot Alignment Check

### Documents that fully reflect the adaptive intelligence pivot:
‚úÖ `VECTOR_COMPLETE_VISION.md` - Fully updated
‚úÖ `VECTOR_GO_TO_MARKET_STRATEGY.md` - Built on new vision
‚úÖ `VECTOR_DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md` - Documents the pivot

### Documents that may need minor updates:
‚ö†Ô∏è `MULTI_TENANT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Core architecture still valid, but should emphasize:
- Conversational AI infrastructure
- Real-time workout modification systems
- User preference learning database

‚ö†Ô∏è `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - Should add:
- AI chat functionality to roadmap
- Adaptation engine as core feature
- User autonomy features

### Documents that remain fully valid:
‚úÖ `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_2025_2028.md` - Timeline and approach unchanged
‚úÖ `PROJECT_STATUS_AND_STRATEGY.md` - Analysis remains accurate
‚úÖ `STATUS_UPDATE_2025_01.md` - Technical progress unchanged

## üéØ Bottom Line

The implementation plans are ~90% still valid. The core technical architecture (multi-tenant, API, database) remains the same. What's changed is the emphasis:

**Before pivot**: Focus on prescriptive accuracy
**After pivot**: Focus on adaptive intelligence and user conversation

The technical work is identical - you still need the same database, API, and frontend. You just present it differently to users (as an advisor, not a dictator).

No need to rewrite technical docs - just keep the new philosophy in mind as you build!
